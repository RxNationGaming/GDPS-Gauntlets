For each tool listed in this page, you'll need the `createPack` permission.

## Mappack Creation
Using the "New Pack" tool, you are able to create a Mappack with any color, star/secret coin reward and add any levels, no matter how many.  
Please note though that Mappacks will be sorted by their own ID's by default, meaning that the most recent mappacks land up in the last page, while the oldest one will appear first. You can configurate it to sort by Name or Difficulty (and Name) in `config/packs.php`.

**NOTE**: Any pack should NOT have more than 10 stars and more than 2 secret coins. This can result the game crashing.

## Gauntlet Creation
Like on the first one, there is also a "New Gauntlet" tool. But unlike Mappacks, you are only able to add 5 levels and choose the gauntlet style.  
Currently, there are 15 known gauntlet assigned to an ID as of update v2.1. Please note that all gauntlets have a hardcoded name.

**NOTE**: If you are using the old tool, you'll need to use the ID's listed below. The new tool (that will be provided in the dashboard soon) will have a dropdown menu to select the gauntlet.

- 0: Unknown (has Fire Gauntlet texture)
- 1: Fire
- 2: Ice
- 3: Poison
- 4: Shadow
- 5: Lava
- 6: Bonus
- 7: Chaos  
[!] Gauntlets below will have a red name, those will require you to have a purple key and beat chaos gauntlet.

[!] Gauntlets below were added in update 2.11.
- 9: Time
- 10: Crystal
- 11: Magic
- 12: Spike
